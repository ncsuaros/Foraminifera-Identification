# Foraminifera-Identification
A Keras implementation for foraminifera identification. Data set and detailed project description are available on website: https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/foram-identification/

## Steps to run the code
Step1: please download and extract the forams images 'NCSU-CUB Foram Images 01' to the same folder as the scripts.

Step2: run keras_extract_features.py to extract features from pre-trained models.

Step3: run keras_train_new_layers.py to train the new fully-connected layers for forams classification.
